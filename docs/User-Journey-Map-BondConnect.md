# User Journey Map — BondConnect

---

## Principles (cross-cutting)

- **Sender and receiver both see their own current social bar** in invite/accept/reschedule flows.

---

## Persona 1: Mike

Mike is a 38-year-old who has worked in commercial real estate for 20 years. He's married, has 3 children, and his kids play soccer. On the weekends he catches up with work.

---

## Journey 1: Starting point

1. Mike downloads the app.
2. Creates an account.
3. The app may prompt for **notification and calendar permissions** (optional). User can set **when to get notifications** (e.g. preferred time, quiet hours, reminder lead time).
4. He wants to connect with his high school friend Tom, whom he hasn't seen in years.
5. He opens the **Calendar** or **Events** tab (calendar view with [+ Add]), taps **[+ Add]**, and chooses from a list of three options — **Quick Phone Call** (15 min), **Deep Talk** (30 min), or **Event** (or **Customize event** for a custom type). When creating, he sees his **current social bar** and, once the date is set, **impact that day**. He picks **Deep Talk**.
6. He selects the person to speak to — Tom (already registered in the system).
7. The system shows a review screen; he chooses to send invite by **text, email, or both**; everything looks ok. He accepts.
8. The system sends an invitation to Tom, and the event is in **Pending** status.

---

## Journey 2: Scheduling with multiple people

1. Opens the app (already installed and logged in).
2. The main home screen opens.
3. User opens the **Calendar** or **Events** tab (calendar view with [+ Add]), taps **[+ Add]**, and chooses **Event** from the three options (or **Customize event** for a custom type). When creating, user sees **current social bar** and, once date is set, **impact that day**.
4. User enters the length of the event (1 hour to any length), description, time and date, location, RSVP optional.
5. User selects the people to invite (e.g. Tom, Ashley, Jamie, Adam — as many as they want). Contacts must already be registered in the system.
6. The system shows a review screen; user chooses to send invite by **text, email, or both**; everything looks ok. User accepts.
7. The system sends an invitation to the selected contacts, and the event is in **Pending** status.

---

## Journey 3: Adding a new contact

1. Open the app (already installed and logged in).
2. The main home screen opens.
3. User clicks on the **Contacts** tab and **[+ Add]**, which shows:
   - Name, phone, email (separate)
   - Status (Friend, Partner, Family, Work)
   - City
   - Cadence (e.g. how often to connect: Weekly, Bi-weekly, Monthly)
4. User can **send invite by text, email, or both** (with editable pre-written prompt); or **add via QR** — scan their BondConnect QR code, or **show my QR code** for them to scan.
5. The system shows a review screen; everything looks ok. User accepts.
6. The system sends an invitation to the new contact, and the contact is in **Pending** status.

---

## Journey 4: Notification

1. Opens the app (already installed and logged in).
2. The main home screen opens.
3. A notification appears; user can click it (optional), which leads to the **Inbox** tab.
4. User clicks on the **Inbox** tab, which shows:
   - **Weekly social bar** (your social energy used this week)
   - **Per-request impact** (how much % each event adds to your social bar)
   - **Invitee sees their current social bar** (week or event date) **and impact of accepting**
   - Number of requests; request sent by: contact name, status (Friend, Partner, Family, Work), location/city, time last sent, duration
   - **When contact typically checks inbox or responds** (e.g. often morning/late evening; rarely late morning/afternoon)
   - **New contact requests:** **Accept / Let's schedule** or **Decline**
5. User **accepts**, **reschedules**, or **declines** (for event invites); for new contacts, user chooses **Accept / Let's schedule** or **Decline**. The system shows a confirm/review step as needed. User ends up in the **Contacts** tab. (Optional: can go to the **Calendar** or **Events** tab.)

> **Principle:** Sender and receiver both see their own current social bar in invite/accept/reschedule flows.

---

## Journey 5: Not able to do the dates

1. Opens the app (already installed and logged in).
2. The main home screen opens.
3. Notification appears; user can click it (optional), which leads to the **Inbox** tab.
4. User clicks on the **Inbox** tab and sees the reason for the request:
   - Sent by: contact name, status, location/city, time last sent
   - Duration, description, and length of the event
   - **Invitee sees their current social bar** (week or event date) **and impact of accepting**
   - **When contact typically checks inbox or responds** (e.g. often morning/late evening; rarely late morning/afternoon)
5. User can **Accept**, **Reschedule**, or **Decline**.
   - **Accept** — System shows a confirm screen; everything looks ok. User ends up in the Contacts tab.
   - **Reschedule** — System shows **both parties’ social bar and impact**; **each suggested time shows impact that day**. User picks a slot or a new date/time, then sends a new time proposal to the sender.
   - **Decline** — Sender gets a notification that it doesn’t fit the schedule.
6. The system sends to the user, and the event remains in **Pending** status.

> **Principle:** Sender and receiver both see their own current social bar in invite/accept/reschedule flows.

## Journey 6: New contact — invite from friend, partner, family, or colleague

1. User receives a standard text message, email, or social message that contains a link.
2. New user clicks the link. **If the app is already installed**, the link opens the app (Splash: “You’re invited to connect”). **If not**, the link goes to the app store to download the app.
3. Creates an account.
4. New user gets a tutorial (short video on how to use the app) or can **skip** it.
   - **Skip** — Notifications and a **Support** tab help users find videos and troubleshooting.
   - **Continue** — Tutorial videos cover: Social Bar, scheduling, Contacts, Inbox, and Home.
5. The app may prompt for **notification and calendar permissions** (optional). User can set **when to get notifications** (e.g. preferred time, quiet hours, reminder lead time).
6. User has all tabs ready to use.

## Journey 8: Post-Event Check-in
